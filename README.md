## Node installation

To run this application you should have node installed. You can install node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Choose installation method for your own operating system. I prefer you to install node version of 16.13.0.

Once you have node installed you can verify it by using command ```node -v```. You can also verify that you have npm with command ```npm -v```.
